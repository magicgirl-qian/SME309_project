# SME309_project
# About the course and project
This is a project of SME309, Microprocessor Design, SUSTech. We designed a superscalar CPU in ARM v3.
SME309 is a compulsory course for undergraduates in Microelectronics Department, SUSTech. It is taught by Prof. Lin Longyang.
Though the course is not very hard, the bonus of project is time-consuming, for details of superscalar processer is not involved in the lecture.
# our motivation
We hope to optimize our processor as better as we can and write a brief tutorial for junior students.
So when they have trouble in the project, they can refer to our solution.
# my professional level
I am an ordinary year-3 undergraduate in Microelectronics Department. Compared to students majored in computer science in world-class university like USTC and UCAS, I am poor in computer architecture.
If you are interested in CPU design, you are suggested to access [NSCSCC](http://www.nscscc.com/) and [ysyx](https://ysyx.oscc.cc/docs/). There are more excellent projects.
