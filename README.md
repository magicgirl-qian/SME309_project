# SME309_project
# About the course and project
This is a project of SME309, Microprocessor Design, SUSTech. We would design a superscalar CPU in ARM v3.
SME309 is a compulsory course for undergraduates in Microelectronics Department, SUSTech. It is taught by Prof. Lin Longyang.
Though the course is not very hard, the bonus of project is time-consuming, for details of superscalar processer is not involved in the lecture.

The deadline of it is 2024/01/19. I will update daily before the deadline.
# Suggestions to junior students
If you are a class-2022(or junior) student in SUSTech and you want the bonus in SME309, our project may help you.
If you only want to get 100, you can refer to other projects in Github.
# My professional level
I am an ordinary year-3 undergraduate in Microelectronics Department. Compared to students majored in computer science in world-class university like USTC and UCAS, I am poor in computer architecture. My teammates are at the same level as me. Our project is far from perfect. I think you are clever enough to debug and do better than us.
If you are interested in CPU design, you are suggested to access [NSCSCC](http://www.nscscc.com/) and [ysyx](https://ysyx.oscc.cc/docs/). There are more excellent projects.
